# NLP


1. What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

2. NLP Pipeline
A typical NLP pipeline includes:

Text Collection

Text Preprocessing

Feature Extraction

Model Building

Evaluation

3. Core NLP Concepts
ðŸ”¹ Tokenization
Breaking down text into smaller units like words or sentences.

python
Copy
Edit
# Example using nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
word_tokenize("I love NLP!")
ðŸ”¹ Stop Words Removal
Removing common words (e.g., "the", "is") that do not carry important meaning.

ðŸ”¹ Stemming and Lemmatization
Stemming: Reduces words to their root form (e.g., "playing" â†’ "play")

Lemmatization: Reduces words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "better" â†’ "good")

ðŸ”¹ POS Tagging (Parts of Speech)
Labeling each word with its grammatical role (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identifying names of people, places, organizations, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Bag of Words (BoW)
A method of feature extraction that converts text into fixed-length vectors based on word frequency.

ðŸ”¹ TF-IDF (Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency)
Gives weight to words based on their importance across documents.

ðŸ”¹ Word Embeddings
Dense vector representations of words capturing context:

Word2Vec

GloVe

FastText

ðŸ”¹ Language Modeling
Predicting the next word in a sequence. Used in autocomplete and speech recognition.

N-Gram Models

Neural Language Models

Transformers

4. Advanced NLP Topics
ðŸ”¸ Transformers
Deep learning models for NLP that handle sequential data more efficiently than RNNs (e.g., BERT, GPT).

ðŸ”¸ Attention Mechanism
A technique that helps models focus on relevant parts of the input when generating output.

ðŸ”¸ Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)
Used in machine translation, summarization, etc.

ðŸ”¸ Text Classification
Assigning categories to text (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).

ðŸ”¸ Sentiment Analysis
Identifying sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from text.

ðŸ”¸ Question Answering
Building systems that answer questions from a given context using models like BERT or LangChain.

ðŸ”¸ Chatbots
Dialogue systems that simulate conversation with users using NLP.
